To fix the `calc()` issue, ensure the parent element has a defined width and that any margins or padding affecting the parent are considered when calculating the child element's dimensions.

For instance, if you're using `calc(100% - 10px)`, make sure the parent element has a specific width (e.g., `width: 500px;`) or inherits a width from its parent. Alternatively, adjust the calculation to account for potential padding or borders on the parent element.  Consider using the `box-sizing` property to control how padding and borders are included in the element's total width and height.

Example of a corrected implementation:

```css
.parent {
  width: 500px;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding and border in width calculation */
  padding: 10px;
}

.child {
  width: calc(100% - 20px); /* Subtract double padding */
}
```
